The angles of the magnetization density are introduced as collective variables in density functional theory. The equations and technique can be simultaneously combined with those of first-principles molecular dynamics for the consistent treatment of spin-lattice interactions. Stochastic and deterministic approaches for treating finite temperature effects are introduced for such dynamics.

Finally the electron--electron intra-atomic interactions are taken into account in the Hartree--Fock approximation.

This dynamical simulation model treats each atom as a particle supporting a classical spin. A coordinate dependent on both exchange and anisotropic functions ensures a minimal coupling between the spin and the lattice degrees of freedom to translate the magnetostrictive behavior of most magnetic materials. A spin-pair model of anisotropy is proposed to connect to the lattice thermodynamics. In order to solve linked spin-coordinate equations of motion, the efficiencies of algorithms based on Suzuki-Trotter decompositions are compared. The temperature dependence of the magnetic behavior of Co nanowires is investigated through thermal stochastic connections with mechanical and spin Langevin noises. From a magnetic Hamiltonian parametrized on ab initio calculations, the size dependence of the energy barriers and characteristic time scales of the magnetization relaxation are computed. In the superparamagnetic limit, it is shown that all spins in a nanowire evolve in a coherent rotation. When the size of the single nanowire increases, nucleations of domain walls let the activation energy be independent of the length of the wire.},

The exchange interaction between Ni (or Fe) adatoms on Pt(111) can be considerably increased by introducing Pt chains to link them. The magnetic ordering can be regulated allowing for ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic configurations. Noncollinear magnetic alignments can also be stabilized by changing the number of Pt-mediated atoms.

The Dzyaloshinskii--Moriya interaction, , being chiral and driven by relativistic effects, leads to the stabilization of highly-noncollinear spin textures such as skyrmions, which thanks to their topological nature are promising building blocks for magnetic data storage and processing elements. Here, we reveal and study a new chiral pair interaction, , which is the biquadratic equivalent of the DMI. First, we derive this interaction and its guiding principles from a microscopic model, and we connect the atomistic form to the micromagnetic one. Second, we study its properties in the simplest prototypical systems, magnetic 3d transition metal dimers deposited on the Pt(111), Pt(100), Ir(111), and Re(0001) surfaces, resorting to systematic first-principles calculations. Lastly, we discuss its importance and implications not only for magnetic dimers but also for extended systems, namely one-dimensional spin spirals and complex two-dimensional magnetic structures, such as a nanoskyrmion lattice found in an Fe monolayer on Ir(111).},

In practice, however, there are multiple connections between the two. This review focuses on these connections. After some background and introductory material on DFT and on model Hamiltonians, we describe four distinct, but complementary, connections between the two approaches: (i) the use of DFT as input for model Hamiltonians, in order to calculate model parameters such as the Hubbard U and the Heisenberg J. (ii) The use of model Hamiltonians as input for DFT, as in the LDA~+~U functional. (iii) The use of model Hamiltonians as theoretical laboratories to study aspects of DFT. (iv) The use of special formulations of DFT as computational tools for studying spatially inhomogeneous model Hamiltonians. We mostly focus on this fourth combination, model DFT, and illustrate it for the Hubbard model and the Heisenberg model. Other models that have been treated with DFT, such as the PPP model, the Gaudin--Yang {$\delta$}-gas model, the XXZ chain, variations of the Anderson and Kondo models and Hooke's atom are also briefly considered. Representative applications of model DFT to electrons in crystal lattices, atoms in optical lattices, entanglement measures, dynamics and transport are described.},

Based on a simple argument of orbital overlaps, it successfully predicts the transition from antiferromagnetism to ferromagnetism, when traversing the 3d series. In a previous article [Phys. Rev. Lett. 116, 217202 (2016)] we reported that the dominant nearestneighbour (NN) interaction for 3d metals in the bcc structure indeed follows the BS curve, but the trends through the series showed a richer underlying physics than was initially assumed. The orbital decomposition of the inter-site exchange couplings revealed that various orbitals contribute to the exchange interactions in a highly non-trivial and sometimes competitive way. In this communication we perform a deeper analysis by comparing 3d metals in the bcc and fcc structures. We find that there is no coupling between the Egorbitals of one atom and T2gorbitals of its NNs, for both cubic phases. We demonstrate that these couplings are forbidden by symmetry and formulate a general rule allowing to predict when a similar situation is going to happen. In {$\gamma$}-Fe, as in {$\alpha$}-Fe, we find a strong competition in the symmetry-resolved orbital contributions and analyse the differences between the high-spin and low-spin solutions.},

The highly spin-polarized 3d4s electrons give rise to directional bonding, magnetism, and Jahn-Teller distortions, yielding structures where the bonding is maximized but high magnetic moments still remain, coupled ferromagnetically. The magnetization is enhanced relative to the bulk, in qualitative agreement with experimental data for clusters larger than fifty atoms. Short d-type bond lengths dominate for dimers and trimers. Both short (d-type) and longer 4s bonds occur for the tetramers. For the pentamers there are many single s bonds and the Re approach the bulk values.},

Its efficiency allows to determine the N{\'e}el temperature considering structural fluctuations, entropic effects, and defects.

The latter are computed using a technique based on constrained density-functional theory, within the local spin-density approximation and the pseudopotential plane-wave method. Calculations for iron show an excellent agreement with experiments.},

  abstract = {Most metallic elements have a crystal structure that is either body-centered cubic (bcc), face-centered close packed, or hexagonal close packed. If the bcc lattice is the thermodynamically most stable structure, the close-packed structures usually are dynamically unstable, i.e., have elastic constants violating the Born stability conditions or, more generally, have phonons with imaginary frequencies. Conversely, the bcc lattice tends to be dynamically unstable if the equilibrium structure is close packed. This striking regularity essentially went unnoticed until ab initio total-energy calculations in the 1990s became accurate enough to model dynamical properties of solids in hypothetical lattice structures. After a review of stability criteria, thermodynamic functions in the vicinity of an instability, Bain paths, and how instabilities may arise or disappear when pressure, temperature, and/or chemical composition is varied are discussed. The role of dynamical instabilities in the ideal strength of solids and in metallurgical phase diagrams is then considered, and comments are made on amorphization, melting, and low-dimensional systems. The review concludes with extensive references to theoretical work on the stability properties of metallic elements.},

Two powerful methods for the ab initio calculation of adiabatic spin-wave spectra are introduced, a frozen-magnon-torque method for systems with large exchange fields and a transverse-susceptibility method which may be used also for materials with smaller exchange fields. The efficiency of both methods results from the fact that the number of calculations required to obtain the spin-wave spectrum scales linearly with the number of basis atoms in the unit cell. Results are given for Fe, Co, Ni, permalloy Ni3Fe, and CoFe, materials which are often used for thin-film technologies.},

Thereby the intra-atomic noncollinearity is neglected for the calculation of the exchange-correlation energy by taking into account only those components of the spin density which are parallel to spin quantization axes (SQAs) defined for the whole atomic spheres. When the magnetic moment directions are calculated in a self-consistent manner, e.g., for systems with intrinsic noncollinearity or when calculating the response of the system to a weak external field with components perpendicular to the moment directions, the SQAs are conventionally chosen to be parallel to the magnetic moments. We present both theoretical arguments and test calculations showing that this choice of SQAs is not the best and may in certain situations lead to wrong results. As a consequence of our arguments we can suggest a better choice of SQAs. Furthermore, a version of the linear-muffin-tin-orbital method is presented where the atomic-sphere approximation for the spin directions and the introduction of local SQAs are not required so that the intraatomic noncollinearity appears already in the basis functions.},

The wave-number-dependent exchange constant matrix is obtained from spin-density-functional calculations with constrained moment directions. The central assumption considers a fast electronic and a slow magnetic time scale, and postulates negligible correlation of the fast motion between different ionic sites. The parameter-free calculated magnon spectra for Fe, Co, and Ni are in excellent agreement with available experimental data. In the case of Fe, they show strong Kohn anomalies. Using Planck statistics at low temperature, the temperature dependence of the magnetization is well described up to half the Curie temperature.

Using spin-polarized scanning tunnelling microscopy we can directly image this non-collinear spin texture in real space on the atomic scale and demonstrate that it is incommensurate to the underlying atomic lattice.

The conclusions drawn from the study are argued to be general for DMS systems in the low concentration limit, although all simulations are done for 5\% Mn-doped GaAs with various concentrations of As antisite defects. The magnetization curve, \$M(T)\$, and the Curie temperature \$T\_C\$ have been calculated, and are found to be in good correspondence to results from Monte Carlo simulations and experiments. Furthermore, equilibrium and non-equilibrium behavior of the magnetic pair correlation function have been extracted. The dynamics of DMS systems reveals a substantial short ranged magnetic order even at temperatures at or above the ordering temperature, with a non-vanishing pair correlation function extending up to several atomic shells. For the high As antisite concentrations the simulations show a short ranged anti-ferromagnetic coupling, and a weakened long ranged ferromagnetic coupling. For sufficiently large concentrations we do not observe any long ranged ferromagnetic correlation. A typical dynamical response shows that starting from a random orientation of moments, the spin-correlation develops very fast (\${\textbackslash}sim\$ 1ps) extending up to 15 atomic shells. Above \${\textbackslash}sim\$ 10 ps in the simulations, the pair correlation is observed to extend over some 40 atomic shells. The autocorrelation function has been calculated and compared with ferromagnets like bcc Fe and spin-glass materials. We find no evidence in our simulations for a spin-glass behaviour, for any concentration of As antisites. Instead the magnetic response is better described as slow dynamics, at least when compared to that of a regular ferromagnet like bcc Fe.},

The program is based on the Green's function method with the local rigid spin rotation treated as a perturbation. As input, the package uses the output of either Wannier90, which is interfaced with many density functional theory packages, or of codes based on localized orbitals. One of the main interests of the code is that it requires only one first-principles electronic structure calculation in the non-relativistic case (or three in the relativistic case) and from the primitive cell only to obtain the magnetic interactions up to long distances, instead of first-principles calculations of many different magnetic configurations and large supercells. The output of TB2J can be used directly for the adiabatic magnon band structure and spin dynamics calculations. A minimal user input is needed, which allows for easy integration into high-throughput workflows.

It can make use of the Wannier function Hamiltonian, which can be constructed from many first principles codes, or localized orbital based codes. Solution method: It uses the magnetic force theorem and takes the rigid spin rotation as a perturbation to the electronic structure. The energy variation is calculated from the Green's functions from tight-binding like Hamiltonian based on Wannier functions or localized orbitals. Additional comments including restrictions and unusual features: Isotropic exchange, anisotropic exchange, and Dzyaloshinskii--Moriya interactions can all be computed with the input of many DFT codes through the interface of Wannier90, or directly from localized orbital codes. The magnetic interaction parameters up to any distance can be computed from one DFT calculation. A minimum user-input is required which provides a black-box like experience. It generates output for several spin dynamics codes and thus bridges the first principles electronic structure simulation with the large scale spin dynamics simulation.},

Here we derive the Gilbert term from first-principles by a nonrelativistic expansion of the Dirac equation.

The resultant expression for the intrinsic volume susceptibility decreases slowly with increasing field; at high fields the functional dependence is as the inverse square root of the field. The variation with temperature is linear; at room temperature and for fields of about 4000 gauss, the order of magnitude of the (volume) susceptibility is 10-4.

The implementation makes use of energy weighted springs for the distribution of the discretization points along the path and this is found to improve performance significantly. The various methods are applied to several test problems using a Heisenberg-type Hamiltonian, extended in some cases to include Dzyaloshinskii--Moriya and exchange interactions beyond nearest neighbours. Minimum energy paths are found for magnetization reversals in a nano-island, collapse of skyrmions in two-dimensional layers and annihilation of a chiral bobber near the surface of a three-dimensional magnet. The LBFGS-OSO method is found to outperform the dynamics based approaches by up to a factor of 8 in some cases.}

We analyze the evolution of the MCA with the number of layers of the slabs. The decomposition of MCA into contributions of atomic sites helps understanding the oscillatory behavior of the MCA with the slab thickness and highlights the role of finite size effects. We also identify some specific systems with enhanced MCA. A k space as well as a band-filling analysis show very rich features of the MCA that could be used to tailor systems with enhanced magnetic properties. Finally, this work can serve as a benchmark for MCA calculations.}

Starting from a large set of data generated by ab initio simulations, we derive noncollinear magnetic many-body potentials for bcc and fcc iron, describing fluctuations of atomic coordinates in the vicinity of near perfect lattice positions. We then use spin-lattice dynamic simulations to evaluate the difference between the free energies of bcc and fcc phases, assessing their relative stability within a unified dynamic picture. We find two intersections between the bcc and fcc free energy curves, which correspond to the {$\alpha-\gamma$} bcc-fcc and {$\gamma-\delta$} fcc-bcc phase transitions. The maximum bcc-fcc free energy difference over the temperature interval between the two phase transitions is 2 meV per atom, in agreement with other experimental and theoretical estimates.}

In addition an expression for the DMI parameters formulated for a micromagnetic model Hamiltonian is presented that provides a connection to the DMI parameters calculated for atomistic Hamiltonians. This formulation also allows the discussion of the DMI in terms of specific features of the electronic band structure.},

The parameters of the extended Hamiltonian are calculated from first principles within the framework of the multiple-scattering Green's function formalism giving access to an explicit representation of these parameters in real space. The discussions are focused on the chiral interactions, i.e., biquadratic and three-spin Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya-like vector interactions {$\rightarrow$}Dijij (BDMI) and {$\rightarrow$}Dijkj (TDMI), respectively, as well as the three-spin chiral interaction Jijk. Although all parameters are driven by spin-orbit coupling (SOC), some differences in their properties are demonstrated by calculations for real materials. In particular it is shown that the three-spin chiral interactions Jijk may be topology as well as SOC induced, while the TDMI is associated only with the SOC. As the magnitude of the chiral interactions can be quite sizable, they can lead to a stabilization of a noncollinear magnetic texture in some materials that is absent when these interactions are neglected.},

Time-dependent SDFT (TD-SDFT), which give for example access to dynamical properties are computationally very demanding and can currently be hardly applied to complex solids. Here we focus on the alternative approach based on the combination of a parameterized phenomenological spin Hamiltonian and SDFT-based electronic structure calculations, giving access to the dynamical and finite-temperature properties for example via spin-dynamics simulations using the Landau--Lifshitz--Gilbert (LLG) equation or Monte Carlo simulations. We present an overview on the various methods to calculate the parameters of the various phenomenological Hamiltonians with an emphasis on the KKR Green function method as one of the most flexible band structure methods giving access to practically all relevant parameters. Concerning these, it is crucial to account for the spin--orbit coupling (SOC) by performing relativistic SDFT-based calculations as it plays a key role for magnetic anisotropy and chiral exchange interactions represented by the DMI parameters in the spin Hamiltonian. This concerns also the Gilbert damping parameters characterizing magnetization dissipation in the LLG equation, chiral multispin interaction parameters of the extended Heisenberg Hamiltonian, as well as spin--lattice interaction parameters describing the interplay of spin and lattice dynamics processes, for which an efficient computational scheme has been developed recently by the present authors.}

The connection between the Bloch and Wannier representations is realized by families of transformations in a continuous space of unitary matrices, carrying a large degree of arbitrariness. Since 1997, methods have been developed that allow one to iteratively transform the extended Bloch orbitals of a first-principles calculation into a unique set of maximally localized Wannier functions, accomplishing the solid-state equivalent of constructing localized molecular orbitals, or ``Boys orbitals'' as previously known from the chemistry literature. These developments are reviewed here, and a survey of the applications of these methods is presented. This latter includes a description of their use in analyzing the nature of chemical bonding, or as a local probe of phenomena related to electric polarization and orbital magnetization. Wannier interpolation schemes are also reviewed, by which quantities computed on a coarse reciprocal-space mesh can be used to interpolate onto much finer meshes at low cost, and applications in which Wannier functions are used as efficient basis functions are discussed. Finally the construction and use of Wannier functions outside the context of electronic-structure theory is presented, for cases that include phonon excitations, photonic crystals, and cold-atom optical lattices.}

The combination of the two techniques allows us to obtain simultaneously information on both the structure and the magnetic state of iron under pressure. The magnetic and structural transitions simultaneously observed are sharp. Both are of first order in agreement with the theoretical prediction. The pressure domain of the transition observed (2.4{\textpm}0.2 GPa) is narrower than that usually cited in the literature (8 GPa). Our data indicate that the magnetic transition slightly precedes the structural one, suggesting that the origin of the instability of the bcc phase in iron with increasing pressure is to be attributed to the effect of pressure on magnetism as predicted by spin-polarized full-potential total energy calculations.}

Here we start from the relativistic Dirac equation and, performing a Foldy--Wouthuysen transformation, derive a generalised Pauli spin Hamiltonian that contains relativistic correction terms to any higher order. Using the Heisenberg equation of spin motion we derive general relativistic expressions for the tensorial Gilbert damping and magnetic inertia parameters, and show that these tensors can be expressed as series of higher-order relativistic correction terms. We further show that, in the case of a harmonic external driving field, these series can be summed and we provide closed analytical expressions for the Gilbert and inertial parameters that are functions of the frequency of the driving field.},

In both cases there is an electronic spin-relaxation term which stems from the spin-orbit interaction. We thus rigorously derive, from fundamental principles, a general expression for the anisotropic damping tensor which is shown to contain an isotropic Gilbert contribution as well as an anisotropic Ising-like and a chiral, Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya-like contribution. The expression for the spin relaxation tensor comprises furthermore both electronic interband and intraband transitions. We also show that when the externally applied electromagnetic field possesses spin angular momentum, this will lead to an optical spin torque exerted on the spin moment.},

The two transitions, inextricably linked in the bulk, are clearly decoupled in the nanoparticles, with the magnetic collapse preceding the structural transition. Ultrafast x-ray emission spectroscopy detects remnant magnetism, probably antiferromagnetic fluctuations, up to pressures of about 40 GPa in the hcp phase.

The theory of the Heisenberg exchange interaction, applied in an earlier paper to the nitrogen molecule at large R, is used to identify the Hartree-Fock configuration of lowest energy and to evaluate the effective exchange integral J. The Hartree-Fock energy has a minimum value with respect to separated atoms in a 9{$\Sigma$}g+ state. The exchange integral is small but negative, so a 1{$\Sigma$}g+ state of complex structure lies below this. The energy of this 1{$\Sigma$}g+ state has a minimum value of -0.79 eV, with respect to separated atoms, at R=2.88 {\AA}, neglecting the part of the net molecular correlation energy that is independent of spin. These two states are members of a closely spaced set with total spin S{$\prime$}=0, 1, 2, 3, 4 coming from the coupling of spins S=2 on each atom. The last occupied {$\sigma$} orbital is of molecular form (bonding molecular orbital, doubly occupied) while the last {$\pi$} and {$\delta$} orbitals are localized and singly occupied. The existence of localized spin-coupled orbitals at equilibrium R is very unusual for diatomic molecules, and this is the distinctive property of magnetic materials expected in the present theory.},

For fluorinated graphene we obtain exchange interactions in fairly good agreement with previous calculations using maximally localized Wannier functions and we confirm the theoretical prediction of a 120{$^\circ$} N{\'e}el state.

This method does not introduce new approximations beyond those found in the Heisenberg-Dirac Hamiltonian and a standard Kohn-Sham Density Functional Theory calculation, and in the limit of an ideal Heisenberg system it reproduces the coupling as determined from spin-projected energy-differences. Our method employs a generalized perturbative approach to constrained density functional theory, where exact expressions for the energy to second order in the constraints are obtained by analytic derivatives from coupled-perturbed theory. When the relative angle between magnetization vectors of metal atoms enters as a constraint, this allows us to calculate all the magnetic exchange couplings of a system from derivatives with respect to local spin directions from the high-spin configuration. Because of the favorable computational scaling of our method with respect to the number of spin-centers, as compared to the broken-symmetry energy-differences approach, this opens the possibility for the blackbox exploration of magnetic properties in large polynuclear transition-metal complexes. In this work we outline the motivation, theory, and implementation of this method, and present results for several model systems and transition-metal complexes with a variety of density functional approximations and Hartree-Fock.},

In this article we describe these new functionalities, that include the implementation of new features for wannierisation and disentanglement (symmetry-adapted Wannier functions, selectively-localised Wannier functions, selected columns of the density matrix) and the ability to calculate new properties (shift currents and Berry-curvature dipole, and a new interface to many-body perturbation theory); performance improvements, including parallelisation of the core code; enhancements in functionality (support for spinor-valued Wannier functions, more accurate methods to interpolate quantities in the Brillouin zone); improved usability (improved plotting routines, integration with high-throughput automation frameworks), as well as the implementation of modern software engineering practices (unit testing, continuous integration, and automatic source-code documentation). These new features, capabilities, and code development model aim to further sustain and expand the community uptake and range of applicability, that nowadays spans complex and accurate dielectric, electronic, magnetic, optical, topological and transport properties of materials.},

We confirmed that our implementation gives good agreement with experiments.

  abstract = {abinit is probably the first electronic-structure package to have been released under an open-source license about 20 years ago. It implements density functional theory, density-functional perturbation theory (DFPT), many-body perturbation theory (GW approximation and Bethe--Salpeter equation), and more specific or advanced formalisms, such as dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) and the ``temperature-dependent effective potential'' approach for anharmonic effects. Relying on planewaves for the representation of wavefunctions, density, and other space-dependent quantities, with pseudopotentials or projector-augmented waves (PAWs), it is well suited for the study of periodic materials, although nanostructures and molecules can be treated with the supercell technique. The present article starts with a brief description of the project, a summary of the theories upon which abinit relies, and a list of the associated capabilities. It then focuses on selected capabilities that might not be present in the majority of electronic structure packages either among planewave codes or, in general, treatment of strongly correlated materials using DMFT; materials under finite electric fields; properties at nuclei (electric field gradient, M{\"o}ssbauer shifts, and orbital magnetization); positron annihilation; Raman intensities and electro-optic effect; and DFPT calculations of response to strain perturbation (elastic constants and piezoelectricity), spatial dispersion (flexoelectricity), electronic mobility, temperature dependence of the gap, and spin-magnetic-field perturbation. The abinit DFPT implementation is very general, including systems with van der Waals interaction or with noncollinear magnetism. Community projects are also described: generation of pseudopotential and PAW datasets, high-throughput calculations (databases of phonon band structure, second-harmonic generation, and GW computations of bandgaps), and the library libpaw. abinit has strong links with many other software projects that are briefly mentioned.}

  abstract = {The article attempts to review the present stage of the density functional theory for noncollinear magnetic states and its application to particular physical problems. The discussion starts with basic theorems of the theory and derivation of the Kohn-Sham equation for a noncollinear magnet. Special features of solving this equation are illustrated using the augmented-spherical-wave method generalized to the noncollinear magnetic structures as an example. Particular attention is devoted to the symmetry of the problem. It is shown that a traditional approach of the space group theory fails in the case of a noncollinear magnetic state. A generalized approach based on the notion of the spin space groups is presented which allows a consequent treatment of the symmetry properties of both nonrelativistic and relativistic problems. This approach allows the development of an exact procedure for a first-principles calculation of an incommensurate spiral structure and gives a sound basis for the calculation and physical interpretation of the noncollinear magnetic structures caused by the effects of relativity. Application of the theory to the first-principles determination of the complex noncollinear magnetic structures of various systems are discussed. Applications include the spiral structure of fcc Fe, the uncompensated magnetic structure in U3X4 and compensated magnetic structure in U2P2Sn, and two different types of weak ferromagnetism in Fe2O3 and Mn3Sn. It is shown how the calculation technique can be applied to studies of unenhanced and enhanced non-uniform magnetic susceptibilities as well as susceptibilities in fields noncollinear to the atomic moments. Illustrating results of the calculation of the susceptibility of various systems are presented. The last part of the review is devoted to applications of the theory of noncollinear magnetism to studies of temperature effects in the electronic properties of itinerant magnets.},

Using a fixed spin disordered local moment state one finds good Curie (or Ne{\'e}l) temperatures, and good energetics for planar spin spirals in the 3d magnets Fe, fcc Co, Ni, Mn, and Cr, though worse agreement for small {\texttheta} spin spirals. On the other hand, the ferromagnetic reference state provides excellent energetics for small {\texttheta} spin spirals in Fe, fcc Co, and Ni, and by extension magnon energies under the assumption of adiabacity. However, planar spin spiral energetics and transition temperatures show worse agreement. The reasons for this, and for the case of fcc Co where both approaches work very well, are discussed. We further provide an extension of the mapping of the quantum problem to include longitudinal fluctuations within force theorem based approaches, and discuss the role they will play in magnetic phase transitions. This construction is tested using planar spin spirals where q is fixed but the moment is allowed to relax. It is demonstrated that results from this approach and directly calculated ab initio values agree very well.},

All approaches are implemented by means of the same Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker (KKR) Green's function formalism. We demonstrate that if properly converged, all procedures yield comparable values, with uncertainties of 5--10\% remaining.

By studying the way in which the moments align with the field at each atomic site, the exchange field may be mapped out. Thus the method may be used to calculate the magnetic couplings between individual atomic moments in the system in some arbitrary magnetic configuration with any desired set of directions and magnitudes of exchange splitting. In this way it is possible, for instance, to model a disordered state above the Curie temperature.

They are designed for linear response near a given magnetic state and in general insufficient to capture arbitrarily strong deviations of spin configurations from the equilibrium. In order to achieve this mapping, we include a linear term in the local spin Hamiltonian that, together with the usual bilinear exchange tensor, produces an improved accuracy of effective magnetic Weiss fields for non-collinear states. We also provide examples from tight-binding electronic structure theory, where our implementation of the calculation of exchange constants is based on constraining fields that stabilize an out-of-equilibrium spin configuration.

This book deals with the dynamics of this magnetization field. It addresses questions of microscopic mechanism only to the extent that residual interactions of the magnetic moments with other degrees of freedom of the host solid affect the dynamics, particularly the dissipative aspects. Several of these damping mechanisms are evaluated here for their effect on the equations of the magnetization dynamics. This dynamics is intrinsically nonlinear. This is important in the applications, particularly magnetic recording, which involves very large motion of the magnetization, well beyond the validity of linearized (small motion) approximations or limited extensions thereof. Therefore nonlinear solution methods are emphasized, but with only minimal use of numerical simulation. The book should be useful to practitioners of magnetic recording, and to physicists studying magnetic phenomena.},

We demonstrate that keeping this term leads to what one should consider a biquadratic effective spin Hamiltonian even in the case of collinear arrangement. In noncollinear systems this term results in new tensor elements that are important for exchange interactions at finite temperatures, but they have less importance at low temperature. To illustrate our results in practice, we calculate for bcc Fe magnon spectra obtained from configuration-dependent exchange parameters, where the configurations are determined by finite-temperature effects.

  abstract = {For large-scale computation of the exchange coupling constants Jij, we reconstruct the Liechtenstein formula for localized orbital representation and simplify the energy integrations by adopting the finite pole approximation of the Fermi function proposed by Ozaki [Phys. Rev. B 75, 035123 (2007)]. We calculate the exchange coupling constant J1NN of the first-nearest-neighbor sites in body-centered-cubic Fe systems of various sizes to estimate the optimal computational parameters that yield appropriate values at the lowest computational cost. It is shown that the number of poles needed for a computational accuracy of 0.05 meV is determined as {$\sim$}60, whereas the number of necessary Matsubara poles needed to obtain similar accuracy, which was determined in previous studies, is on the order of 1000. Finally, we show Jij as a function of atomic distance, and compared it with one derived from Korringa--Kohn--Rostoker Green's function formalism. The distance profile of Jij derived by KKR formalism agrees well with that derived by our study, and this agreement supports the reliability of our newly derived formalism.}

  abstract = {A parallel implementation of coupled spin-lattice dynamics in the LAMMPS molecular dynamics package is presented. The equations of motion for both spin only and coupled spin-lattice dynamics are first reviewed, including a detailed account of how magneto-mechanical potentials can be used to perform a proper coupling between spin and lattice degrees of freedom. A symplectic numerical integration algorithm is then presented which combines the Suzuki-Trotter decomposition for non-commuting variables and conserves the geometric properties of the equations of motion. The numerical accuracy of the serial implementation was assessed by verifying that it conserves the total energy and the norm of the total magnetization up to second order in the timestep size. Finally, a very general parallel algorithm is proposed that allows large spin-lattice systems to be efficiently simulated on large numbers of processors without degrading its mathematical accuracy. Its correctness as well as scaling efficiency were tested for realistic coupled spin-lattice systems, confirming that the new parallel algorithm is both accurate and efficient.},

We validate our implementation by comparison with the frozen phonon method in fcc Ni and in a monatomic ferromagnetic Pt wire.}

We find that differences in the phonon dispersions due to the different orientations of the magnetization (in plane and perpendicular to the plane) give a difference between the vibrational free energies of the high-temperature and low-temperature phases. This vibrational contribution to the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy (MAE) constant, Ku, is non-negligible. When the energy contribution to the MAE is calculated by the PBEsol exchange-correlation functional, the addition of the phonon contribution allows one to get a T=0KKu and a spin-reorientation transition temperature in reasonable agreement with experiments.}

Raman scattering response measured as a function of temperature shows a blue shift of the Raman active modes at 120.2 and 155.1 cm-1, when the temperature is raised across the antiferromagnetic-paramagnetic transition. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations have been performed to estimate the effective exchange interactions and calculate the Raman active phonon modes. The calculations lead to the conclusion that the peculiar behavior with temperature of the two low energy phonon modes can be explained by the symmetry of their corresponding normal coordinates which involve the virtual modification of the super-exchange angles associated with the leading antiferromagnetic (AFM) interactions.},

The derived Hamiltonian describes a closed system of spin and lattice degrees of freedom and explicitly conserves the total momentum, angular momentum and energy. Using a new numerical implementation that corrects earlier Suzuki-Trotter decompositions we perform simulations on the basis of the resulting equations of motion to investigate the combined magnetic and mechanical motion of a ferromagnetic nanoparticle, thereby validating our developed method. In addition to the ferromagnetic resonance mode of the spin system we find another low-frequency mechanical response and a rotation of the particle according to the Einstein-de-Haas effect. The framework developed herein will enable the use of multi-scale modeling for investigating and understanding a broad range of magneto-mechanical phenomena from slow to ultrafast time scales.},
